# Currency converter

# Overview

This is a simple currency converter program written in C. It allows you to convert an amount from one currency to another using hardcoded exchange rates. Please note that this program uses a fixed exchange rate for demonstration purposes. For real-world applications, you should consider fetching up-to-date exchange rates from an external source.

# Technologies Used
- C Programming Language: The core technology used for writing the currency converter program. C is a low-level programming language known for its efficiency and versatility.
- Standard Input/Output Library (stdio.h): This library provides functions for input and output operations in C. It's used to take user input, display output, and perform I/O 
  operations in the program.

# Usgae
Using an online C compiler like OnlineGDB is a convenient way to compile and run C programs, especially if you don't have a C development environment set up on your local machine. These online compilers provide an integrated development environment (IDE) accessible through a web browser. Here's how you can use it:

1) Access the Online Compiler:
+ Open your web browser and visit the OnlineGDB website at
  https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c_compiler.

2) Create a New C Program:
+ Click on the "New" button or navigate to "File" > "New" to create a new C program.

3) Write Your C Code:
+ In the code editor, write or paste your C code (e.g., the currency converter program).

4) Compile and Run:
+ Click the "Run" button, which typically looks like a play button or "â–º."
  The online compiler will compile your code and execute it. You'll see the program's output in the console area below the code editor.

5) Interact with the Program:
+ Follow the on-screen instructions to input currencies and amounts when running your currency converter program.

6) View Output:
+ The output of your program will be displayed in the console area. You can review the converted currency amount there.

# Currency converter

# Overview

This is a simple currency converter program written in C. It allows you to convert an amount from one currency to another using hardcoded exchange rates. Please note that this program uses a fixed exchange rate for demonstration purposes. For real-world applications, you should consider fetching up-to-date exchange rates from an external source.
